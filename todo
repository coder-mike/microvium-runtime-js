# To Do

- Release Microvium.
- Update Microvium version number and update all the version numbers in index.ts

# Nice to have

- Debug API. Could include the ability to read/write memory and to dump a representation of the heap, registers, stack.
- Prototype proxies. This is actually quite complicated to do correctly, I think, because we cannot currently maintain the identity of VM objects in the host, and the identity of prototypes is is important for `instanceof`.

# Done

- Support for passing arguments/return values of:
  - Host functions
  - Closures
  - Objects
  - Arrays
  - Uint8Array
  - Classes
- Exceptions and error codes, including with reentrancy
- Gas counter (mvm_stopAfterNInstructions and mvm_getInstructionCountRemaining)
- Reflect.keys and property enumeration (arrays and objects)
