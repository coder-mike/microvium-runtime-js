# To Do

- Support for passing arguments/return values of:
  - Classes
- Exceptions and error codes, including with reentrancy
- Gas counter (mvm_stopAfterNInstructions and mvm_getInstructionCountRemaining)
- Reflect.keys and property enumeration (arrays and objects)
- The Microvium library doesn't seem to work with linux for me.
- Go over all the remaining TODOs and `notImplemented` in the code
- Get rid of the relative import of microvium in tests (before first release)
- Make sure Terser is still enabled
- Unskip the performance tests
- Remember to change `build.sh` back to release mode (change the build command to use the commented-out release-mode build).

# Nice to have

- Debug API. Could include the ability to read/write memory and to dump a representation of the heap, registers, stack.
- Prototype proxies

# Done

- Support for passing arguments/return values of:
  - Host functions
  - Closures
  - Objects
  - Arrays
  - Uint8Array
