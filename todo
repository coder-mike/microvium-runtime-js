- I've introduced a bug into Microvium on the `wasm` branch that needs to be fixed.
- Snapshot support in API
- Expose GC API
- Support for passing arguments/return values of:
  - Closures (by handle)
  - Objects
  - Arrays
  - Uint8Array
  - Host functions
- Get rid of the relative import of microvium in tests (before first release)
